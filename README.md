# Target Motion Analysis (TMA) Simulator

A web-based Target Motion Analysis simulator that uses Monte Carlo methods to calculate probable solutions for target course, speed, and range based on a series of bearing measurements. Ideal for submarine warfare training, surface ship tracking, and maritime operations education.

## Live Demo

## Features

- Pure HTML/JavaScript implementation with no external dependencies
- Input multiple observation points with heading and relative bearing
- Monte Carlo simulation with configurable parameters
- Calculates probable target course, speed, range, and angle on bow
- Includes confidence intervals for all calculated values
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Four pre-configured examples for learning and testing

## Usage Guidelines

- The more you move between measurements, the better the solution quality will be
- Changing course between measurements is highly beneficial
- At least one course change and a minimum of 4 measurements are recommended
- "My Heading" is your vessel's heading at the time of the measurement
- "Rel. Bearing" is the bearing to the target relative to your own heading (0° is dead ahead, 90° is to starboard)
